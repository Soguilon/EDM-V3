# Midterm Lab Task 2
This portfolio demonstrates the process of data cleaning and preparation using Power Query. The dataset consists of multiple related tables, where cleaning techniques are applied to improve data quality and consistency before analysis.

## Step-by-Step Process
Step 1: Data Cleaning
- Load the raw dataset into Power Query
- Adjust column width and format
- Trim spaces and clean text values
- Remove null values and handle missing data
- Remove duplicate records
- Convert data types for consistency

Step 2: Data Transformation
- Split and merge columns as needed
- Extract relevant data using filters
- Apply conditional transformations
- Create new calculated columns
- Standardize date and numeric formats

Step 3: Data Normalization
- Identify and organize data into structured tables
- Split tables to reduce redundancy
- Establish relationships between tables
- Ensure consistency in key fields

## Here are the screenshots showcasing the table transformation process
