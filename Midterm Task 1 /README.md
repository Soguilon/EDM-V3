## Midterm Lab Task 1
This portfolio demonstrates the process of data normalization and cleaning applied to a transactional database. The dataset consists of multiple related tables, each designed to improve data organization and eliminate redundancy.

## Step by Step Process
Step 1:

Step 2:
- Performed 1NF
- Perform Tablet spilt using 2NF
- Performed 2NF
- Mapped the normalization as a physical data model
