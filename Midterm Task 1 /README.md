## Midterm Lab Task 1
This portfolio demonstrates the process of data normalization and cleaning applied to a transactional database. The dataset consists of multiple related tables, each designed to improve data organization and eliminate redundancy.

## Step by Step Process
Step 1:
- Load the raw file
- Fix collumns width and height
- TRIM words and spaces
- Remove Null values
- Remove Duplicates

Step 2:
- Performed 1NF
- Perform Tablet spilt using 2NF
- Performed 2NF
- Mapped the normalization as a physical data model
